find_cruft - find cruft files on Gentoo and similar distributions

Author: Martin Väth <martin@mvath.de>

This project is under the BSD license.

Gentoo records all installed files in a database.
Files not stored in this database are either manually installed or
intentionally created at runtime or cruft.
find_cruft will output all files which might possibly be cruft.

find_cruft is extremely configurable (by perl code) and has the possibility
to e.g. check only certain subtrees for cruft.
It can also emulate a chroot to some extent if you have a gentoo installation
in a chroot partition.

For detailed usage instructions, type B<find_cruft --man> after installing.

For installation just put the content of bin somewhere into your $PATH
and the content of etc into /usr/lib/find_cruft or into /etc or use
later a corresponding -c option.
Put your local customization into /etc/find_cruft.d or /etc/find_cruft.pl
(this will override the corresponding content of /usr/lib/find_cruft).
Also put the files of the subdirectory zsh into your $fpath to obtain
zsh completion support. (If you do not have root access, you can add the
corresponding directory with fpath+=("...")) before you
call compdef from your zsh initialization files).

For installation under Gentoo, you can use the ebuild from the mv overlay
(which is available by layman).
